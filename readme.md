# Library 
This project was completed as part of The Odin Project. It showcases 
the skills I have developed so far in Git, HTML, CSS, and client-side
JavaScript. Future development of this project could include:

* Filter options (e.g., by media type, read/unread, length)
* Sort capability
* Graphical improvements to differentiate media

As a librarian, I was highly invested in this project and 
thoroughly enjoyed making it. In particular, choosing to
include multiple media types helped highlight the limitations of
object constructors and led me to learn more about classes in
ES6.
